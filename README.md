# **Description**
I merage task 1 page with this task (make them in one page), this website is to help to control the robot arm and base movement. First, In the index.php file, I wrote codes for sliders and buttons. In the conn.php file, I succeeded in making the connection between the website and the database.
In the sl.js file, I wrote javascript codes to assign the sliders to their values. In the style.css file, there are to make the website appearance more acceptable. I used XAMPP as servere. Finally, in robot-arm+direction.sql are codes of the database, there is two  tables one with with 4 columns contain id,motor_name , degree of the slider, and the state :ON/Off and the onther table contain directions.
